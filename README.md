yes i know there are plenty of programs that do the same. But I wanted to create my own just for fun.

run the folowing commands

first install all dependencies

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd client
npm install
```

start backend

```cmd
python main.py
```

start frontend
```cmd
npm start
```
